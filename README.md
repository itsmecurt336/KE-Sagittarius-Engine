# Friday Night Funkin' | Sagittarius Engine
*A direct fork from KadeDev's Kade Engine 1.7*

This fork in particular focuses on combining features of multiple rhythm games combined into one entire mod.
Unlike other mods, this mod won't add new weeks, characters, all that stuff.

This mod was created as a hobby, so expect infrequent and unstable commits.
